        "You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.",

If there isn\u2019t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u2019s weapons also grow to match its new size.

This reduction decreases its size by one category\u2014from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u2019s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target\u2019s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can\u2019t reduce the damage below 1)."
