# 5e-DND-CATALOG
A discord bot for the purpose of sharing PHB races and classes over discord. Planning on adding spells, backgrounds, and equipment in 
later updates, as well allowing users to create, upload, and access their own homebrew creations.

Have you ever started a game of DnD online over discord, and have had literally no clue what you are doing? Per chance, have you
gotten into a spat with your DM about how the Rogue's sneak attack feature works (THEY DON'T NEED ADVANTAGE, JOE, IF AN ALLY IS WITHIN
FIVE FEET OF THE ENEMY IN QUESTION!)? Need a good place to store homebrew and share it with others? Look no further! The 5e DnD Catalog
seeks to solve all these problems!
